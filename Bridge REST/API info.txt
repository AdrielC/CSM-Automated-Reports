Token Security
    Symplicity CSM’s REST API is a powerful tool capable of keeping your site infused with up-to-date
    data. But with great power, comes great responsibility. An authorized user with “Write” access via
    the API will be able to overwrite important records. It is essential to the security of your CSM system
    that only authorized users have access to the API keys. Multiple tokens may be created to allow
    admins to grant granular API access to a given token. Furthermore, we recommend limiting System
    Setting access (which allows for view access to the API tokens) to only Super Users. If you feel that a
    token has been compromised, or needs revoke, please file a support ticket requesting termination of
    access for that token. Testing tokens are not restricted beyond limitation of term of application, they
    will have access to real, live CSM data.

Technical Documentation
    Technical documentation for the REST API is located at: http://docs.enterprisecsm.apiary.io
