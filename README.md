# CSM-Automated-Reports
### This is used to automate reports for BYU for the following purposes:
1) Create a list of all current BYU students (graduating 2017+)
2) Create a list of all 2017-2018 club attendees
3) Create a report of all the students who have attended a club event and are not full members of the club

## Important files
### 1) ClubReportMaster.R
This R script should be run piecewise after running main.py to clean the data and create the reports
### 2) main.py
This python script (python 3) contains all the API calls to the BYU CSM REST API. This should be run first
